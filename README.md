---

## Technologies

Python 3.7.11 with additional libraries:

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23/install.html?msclkid=ff9c78b7babb11eca64153f15c95b1cd/) - to analyze data frames using JupyterLabs.

* [JupyterLabs](https://jupyter.org/install?msclkid=31fe502ebabc11ec946b61bf7f54104d/) - to provide workspace for user.

* [Path](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html?msclkid=8a1725dababc11ecaaddce36ed74fb30/) - import Path from pathlib to read CSV files.

* [IPython.display](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.display.html?msclkid=ad07e72cbabc11ecaad9e35a641d5fdb/) - to help output multiple things in each cell.

## Installation Guide

Other than Python 3.7, no installation is necessary, Jupyter Labs runs in a browser, including Chrome.  Launch the file by navigating to the directory of the file through a CLI and then running Jupyter labs, with "jupyter lab".

## Usage

The worksheet runs through a scenario and allows the user to manipulate arbitrage opportunities between different BTC exchanges.
